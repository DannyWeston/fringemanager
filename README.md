# Simple program for generating fringes on the fly
## and maybe projecting them on a display-based projector

The only dependencies for this are python (3.11.7), numpy, Pillow, and pywin32 - you can find these all in requirements.txt.
It could run on other versions of dependencies but I only tested with these as it is a very simple program...

Note that this program doesn't do any fancy stuff - you can simply choose a display to project fringes on and... project them.
